# Task 1 – Network Sniffer (CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship)

## 👨‍💻 About the Project
This Python-based packet sniffer was created using Scapy. It captures live network packets and prints out key metadata including:
- Source IP
- Destination IP
- Protocol
- Raw payload

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python 3
- Scapy 2.5.0
- PyCharm IDE
- Windows 10 (host)
- Npcap (backend packet capture driver)

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use `scapy` to sniff live packets
- How to handle packet layers and payloads
- Understanding of real-time traffic flow

## 📦 Files Included
- `sniffer.py` — main script
- `output_sample.txt` — sample run (optional)
- Screenshot of terminal output (optional)

## 🔐 Next Steps
This task forms a foundation for deeper packet analysis, such as:
- Writing to log files
- Applying filters
- Identifying suspicious traffic
